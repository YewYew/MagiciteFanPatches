# MagiciteFanPatches
I decided to take it upon myself to update Magicite, since Sean decided to stop work on it for now.

Magicite 2.1 - 3/27/19
Several bugfixes, including some to multiplayer including desync and item duplication.
Enables the Desert Biome.
Along with the desert biome, the following are enabled.
* Snakes
* Cacti
* Palm Trees
* Desert Towns
* Desert Music
Chests and ore have been added to the desert biome, with a higher chance of rare loot including goldium and diamonite.
